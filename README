To build:
	Type 'make'. Makefile will compile and link all necessary modules and produce exectuable-'multi-lookup'
To Run:
	Type './multi-lookup' followed by '<# requester> <# resolver> <requester log> <resolver log> [ <data file> ...]'

	ex: ./multi-lookup 2 2 serviced.txt results.txt names1.txt names2.txt names3.txt

The Makefile should do all necessary building. In addition, using 'make clean' will remove any files generated during the course of building and running the program.
